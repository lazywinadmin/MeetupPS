# Introduction

Thanks for considering contributing to this project! My name is Francois-Xavier Cat ([@lazywinadmin](https://github.com/lazywinadmin)), and I'm excited you're interested in improving something I've written.

I'm happy to consider any contributions, especially ones that add functionality or fix bugs.

## Ground Rules

I really only have one rule for contributions:

> This project is licensed under The MIT License, so your contribution will need to use the same license in order to be accepted.

If I accept your contribution, I'll add you to the Authors/Contributors section in the README.

## How to Contribute

If you would like to make a simple contribution (a few lines or less), please put it in an Issue with the "contribution" label.

For larger contributions, please fork this project, make the changes/additions, and then issue a Pull Request.
Never done a pull request before? There's an easy tutorial [here](http://makeapullrequest.com/).

## How to report a bug

### Vulnerabilities

If you find a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an Issue. Instead, email info@REPLACE-THIS-WITH-MY-GITHUB-USERNAME.com

### Non-Security Bugs

For non-security bugs, please open a GitHub issue with the "bug" label containing the following information:

> 1. What OS and PowerShell version are you using?
> 2. What did you do?
> 3. What did you expect to see?
> 4. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you wish to suggest a feature or enhancement, please enter a GitHub issue with the "enhancement" label detailing the suggestion.

## Code review process

As I'm just one person, and my scripting is a side-project to my normal sysadmin/syseng work, it may take me a while to review.

## Questions

If you have additional questions about contributing, please open a GitHub issue with the "question" tag.

## Code Style

I write all my PowerShell code according to the [PowerShell Best Practices and Style Guide](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle), so any contributions will be altered to match this style if they do not already follow it.

## Notes

This page was created based mostly on [Nate Contributing page](https://github.com/natescherer/ChangelogManagement/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Thank you !
